# Timer

This is a simple web-based countdown timer application with a clean, glassmorphic user interface. It allows users to set a timer in hours, minutes, and seconds, and provides functionality to start, pause, resume, lap, and reset the timer. It also keeps a history of "lapped" times and displays the total accumulated time.
